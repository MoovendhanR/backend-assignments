-props can be used with  state and       -state can be used with the statecomponent/
 functional components.                      class components
-props can be reads only.                -state is both read and write.

4.What is Conditional Rendering?
-In react ,you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need,
-Then you can render only some of them,depending on the state of your application.
-Conditional rendering in React working the same way conditions work in javascript.
ex.
function Greeting(props){
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if(isLoggedIn){
    return <UserGreeting />;

5.Explain how lists work in React?
-lists are used to display data in order format and mainly used to display menus
on websites.
-In React,Lists can be created in similar way as we create lists in javascript.

const multiplyNums = numbers.map((number)=>{   
    return <> 
    <li>{number * 5}</li>
    </>

-it is useful when we dynamically created components or when the user alter the lists.

7.What is memoisation in react?
-memoisation is an feature in React which,when used in the right place,
increases the perfromance of the program.
-React gives us purecomponent and memo to implement memoisation.purecomponent is used 
with the class component and memo is used functional component.

8.What is the difference between react.memo and react.useMemo?
-In useMemo it remember the return value between renders, and in React.memo it remembers
the react component between renders.react.memo is higher-order component that accepts a 
react component memoizes it depending on your props.

9.What are the parameters that react memo takes?
   It takes two parameter one is callback function and second is a dependency

10.What are the different ways to apply useEffect?
-there are four ways to apply useEffect.
 *once, when component mounts
 *on every component render.
 *on every component render with a conditions.
 *when component is unmounted 

 11.How does Routing work with react?
-React router is mainly used for developing single page applications.React Router is 
 used to define multiple routes in the application.
-When a user types a specific URL into the browser,and if this URL path matches any "route" 
 inside the root file,the user will be redirected to that particular route.

12.What is SSR and CSR?
   server side rendering                       client side rendering
-ideal(ஏற்றதாக) for sites serving only   -ideal(ஏற்றதாக) for web apps.
 static(நிலையான) content
-Fast initial page load.                   -Fast rendering after initial page load.
-no js dependency                          -rich site interaction 
-Easy for search engine bots to 
crawl and index a site because the         -Reduces server load.
content exists before the user  
receive it-more straightforward SEO

13.What are the lifecycle methods in class components?
-There are three categories of lifecycle methods:mounting,updating,unmounting.
-A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time.this is when mounting lifecycle methods
get called.  
-The first time the component instance a renders,it does not update.

14.What are dependencies in useEffect?
-useEffect(callback,dependencies) is the hook that manages side effects in functional components.
-callback argument is a function to put the side-effects logic.
-dependencies is a list of dependencies of your side-effect:being props or state value.

15.What is a pure component?
-A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props.
-for this type of class component ,React provides the PureComponent base class.
-class component that extend the React.PureComponent class are treated as pure components.
